# 00 - Setup + Hello

Goal: confirm your Python environment and GitHub workflow (edit → commit → push → tests go green).

## What to do

- Open `src/main.py` and complete the TODOs.
- Run `pytest -q` until all tests pass.
- Commit and push your changes.

## How to run

- Run tests locally:

```bash
pytest -q
```

## What you should implement

- `greet(name: str) -> str`
- `add(a: int, b: int) -> int`
